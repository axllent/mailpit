Mailpit is a multi-platform email testing tool & API for developers.

It acts as both an SMTP server, and provides a web interface to view all captured emails. It also contains an API for automated integration testing.

Mailpit is inspired by [MailHog](#why-rewrite-mailhog), but modern and much, much faster.

## Features

- Runs entirely from a single binary, no installation required
- SMTP server (default `0.0.0.0:1025`)
- Web UI to view emails (formatted HTML, highlighted HTML source, text, headers, raw source and MIME attachments including image thumbnails)
- Light & dark web UI theme with auto-detect
- Mobile and tablet HTML preview toggle in desktop mode
- Advanced mail search ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Mail-search))
- Message tagging ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Tagging))
- Real-time web UI updates using web sockets for new mail
- Optional browser notifications for new mail (HTTPS and `localhost` only)
- Configurable automatic email pruning (default keeps the most recent 500 emails)
- Email storage either in a temporary or persistent database ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Email-storage))
- Fast SMTP processing & storing - approximately 70-100 emails per second depending on CPU, network speed & email size, easily handling tens of thousands of emails
- SMTP relaying / message release - relay messages via a different SMTP server including an optional allowlist of accepted recipients ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/SMTP-relay))
- Optional SMTP with STARTTLS & SMTP authentication, including an "accept anything" mode ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/SMTP-with-STARTTLS-and-authentication))
- Optional HTTPS for web UI ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/HTTPS))
- Optional basic authentication for web UI ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Basic-authentication))
- A simple REST API ([see docs](docs/apiv1/README.md))
- Multi-architecture [Docker images](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Docker-images)


## Installation

The Mailpit web UI listens by default on `http://0.0.0.0:8025`, and the SMTP port on `0.0.0.0:1025`.

Mailpit runs as a single binary and can be installed in different ways:


### Install via Brew (Mac)

Install Mailpit with `brew install mailpit`.


### Install via bash script (Linux & Mac)

Linux & Mac users can install it directly to `/usr/local/bin/mailpit` with:

```bash
sudo bash < <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axllent/mailpit/develop/install.sh)
```


### Download static binary (Windows, Linux and Mac)

Static binaries can always be found on the [releases](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/releases/latest). The `mailpit` binary can extracted and copied to your `$PATH`, or simply run as `./mailpit`.


### Docker

See [Docker instructions](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Docker-images) for 386, amd64 & arm64 images.


### Compile from source

To build Mailpit from source see [building from source](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Building-from-source).


### Testing Mailpit

Please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Testing-Mailpit) of how to easily test email delivery to Mailpit.


### Configuring sendmail

Mailpit's SMTP server (by default on port 1025), so you will likely need to configure your sending application to deliver mail via that port. A common MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) that delivers system emails to a SMTP server is `sendmail`, used by many applications including PHP. Mailpit can also act as substitute for sendmail. For instructions of how to set this up, please refer to the [sendmail documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Configuring-sendmail).


## Why rewrite MailHog?

I had been using MailHog for a few years to intercept and test emails, but experienced a number of severe performance issues. Many of the frontend and Go libraries are very out of date, and the project [is no longer maintained](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/442#issuecomment-1493415258).

Initially I tried to upgrade a fork of MailHog (the UI, the HTTP server and the API), but discovered that it is (with all due respect to its authors) far too complex. I found it over-engineered (split over 9 separate projects), and performs very poorly when dealing with large amounts of emails or emails with attachments (a single email with a 3MB attachment can take over a minute to ingest). Finally the API transmits a lot of duplicate & irrelevant data on every browser request, all without any HTTP compression.

In order to improve it I felt it needed to be completely rewritten, and so Mailpit was born.
