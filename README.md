Mailpit is a small, fast, low memory, zero-dependency, multi-platform email testing tool & API for developers.

It acts as an SMTP server, provides a modern web interface to view & test captured emails, and contains an API for automated integration testing.

Mailpit was originally **inspired** by MailHog which is now [no longer maintained](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/442#issuecomment-1493415258) and hasn't seen active development for a few years now.

## Features

- Runs entirely from a single binary, no installation required
- SMTP server (default `0.0.0.0:1025`)
- Web UI to view emails (formatted HTML, highlighted HTML source, text, headers, raw source and MIME attachments including image thumbnails)
- HTML check to test & score mail client compatibility with HTML emails
- Link check to test message links (HTML & text) & linked images
- Screenshots of HTML messages via web UI ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/HTML-screenshots))
- Mobile and tablet HTML preview toggle in desktop mode
- Light & dark web UI theme with auto-detect

- Fast SMTP processing & storing - approximately 70-100 emails per second depending on CPU, network speed & email size, easily handling tens of thousands of emails
- SMTP relaying / message release - relay messages via a different SMTP server including an optional allowlist of accepted recipients ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/SMTP-relay))
- Optional SMTP with STARTTLS & SMTP authentication, including an "accept anything" mode ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/SMTP-with-STARTTLS-and-authentication))

## Installation

The Mailpit web UI listens by default on `http://0.0.0.0:8025`, and the SMTP port on `0.0.0.0:1025`.

Mailpit runs as a single binary and can be installed in different ways:


### Install via Brew (Mac)

Install Mailpit with `brew install mailpit`.

To run automatically run mailpit in the background, run `brew services start mailpit`.


### Install via bash script (Linux & Mac)

Linux & Mac users can install it directly to `/usr/local/bin/mailpit` with:

```bash
sudo bash < <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axllent/mailpit/develop/install.sh)
```


### Download static binary (Windows, Linux and Mac)

Static binaries can always be found on the [releases](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/releases/latest). The `mailpit` binary can extracted and copied to your `$PATH`, or simply run as `./mailpit`.


### Docker

See [Docker instructions](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Docker-images) for 386, amd64 & arm64 images.


### Compile from source

To build Mailpit from source see [building from source](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Building-from-source).


## Usage

Run `mailpit -h` to see options. More information can be seen in [the docs](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Runtime-options).

If installed using homebrew, you may run `brew services start mailpit` to run always run mailpit automatically.

### Testing Mailpit

Please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Testing-Mailpit) of how to easily test email delivery to Mailpit.


### Configuring sendmail

Mailpit's SMTP server (by default on port 1025), so you will likely need to configure your sending application to deliver mail via that port. A common MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) that delivers system emails to a SMTP server is `sendmail`, used by many applications including PHP. Mailpit can also act as substitute for sendmail. For instructions of how to set this up, please refer to the [sendmail documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Configuring-sendmail).
