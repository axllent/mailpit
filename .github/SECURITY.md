# Reporting security vulnerabilities

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, you can report it using one of the following methods:

2. **Email:** Send your findings to security@axllent.org

Your report should include:

- Mailpit version
- A vulnerability description
- Reproduction steps (if applicable)
- Any other details you think are likely to be important

You should receive an initial acknowledgement within 24 hours in most cases, and will be kept updated throughout the process.

With your consent, your contributions will be publicly acknowledged.
